 5250 Weblog Records File Maintenance

   WEBVISITOR / WEBBLOCKER are programs I wrote to help administer my website. They are written in RPG /free with subprocedures and service program. The subfile is page by page style with windowed maintenance screens.

   This could serve as an ILE shell program for any 5250 file maintenance program or application by replacing and extending the code in place. There are no copyright, license, or disclaimer statements as a requirement to carry along.
